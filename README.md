# RadixDB

RadixDB is a lightweight database built on a [Radix tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree) structure.
While initially implemented in Go, the database file format is platform-agnostic.
This allows easy read and write from any programming language, without special bindings.

RadixDB is currently in active development. We plan to announce its readiness for
general availability when appropriate. Stay tuned for updates.
