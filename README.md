RadixDB is a lightweight database built on a [Radix tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree) structure.
While initially implemented in Go, the database file format is platform-agnostic.
This allows easy read and write from any programming language, without special bindings.

üèóÔ∏è RadixDB is currently in active development. We plan to announce its readiness for
general availability when appropriate. Stay tuned for updates.
